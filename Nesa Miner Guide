# Nesa Miner Testnet Setup Guide

Nesa is the lightweight Layer-1 executing critical AI inference on queries that require a high degree of privacy, security, and trust using advanced methods on-chain, including zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML), split learning (SL), and more.
Nesa was created as an alternative to ChatGPT and other inference platforms today that are centralized and controlled by major players. These platforms have zero visibility or accountability in their output on your critical transactions and provide zero privacy in your data and results. This is a big problem in AI.
This guide will help you set up an Arkeo node for the testnet.
